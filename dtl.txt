DJANGO TEMPLATING LANGUAGE.

Terms used in DTL

Template is a text file
Django templating language is  a system designed to  express presentation not programme logic.
It is responsible for logical flow of the code.
The django templating system provides tags which funtions like other programming constructs eg a boolean for test and for loop for looping.
In templating language we use tags
Tags,they a used for presentation flow 
the tags are not executed  as corresponding codes however 
they are  evaluated whenever the template is evaluated.


NB:
VARRIABLES.
*It is written with 2 curl blaces eg
{{demi}},{{car}}

*It is not stored in the template however a templating engine 
evaluates  it with their results.
This arriable is picked from the views by the templating engine.

Varriable names should;
- not include spaces
- not start with an underscore,or a number or a dot-(.)
-when accessing the name, the exact view is what should be called.
-whatever you put within the {{}} is read as a varriable name
-we cannot calculate within the template however we can calculate 
from the views and send the results to template.
-we serve the index that is inheriting from the base.

TAGS{% tag %}
- Tags  are written with modulus eg {% esther/demi %},{% django %}
Tags are more complex than varriables, some create text in the  output, 
some  control presentation flow by forming loops or logic,eg, {% for %} ,{% if %}
and some load external information from the views or other templates to be used 
by later varriables.eg {% extends %}.
-some tags require a beggining and ending tag , i.e {% tag %}...content ... {% endtag %} eg, 
{% block content %} ...content...{% endblock %}
whereas some don't, eg, {% extends 'parent_template.html' %}
-There should always  be space btn % signs and the tag name.
-The tag name is never written in capital letters or with a number or an(_) or  a symbol .

-EXAMPLES OF TAGS USED IN DJANGO TEMPLATING LANGUAGE
1. Extends {% extends 'parent_template.html' %}
-- This tag is used to inherit template/base layouts
-- It does not require an opening and  closing tags

2. Load {% load static %}
-- This is used to load external information or files from the django static folder,
 eg , css, images, audios, videos ,js e.t.c.
-- This also does not require  a closing tag.

3. For tag, i.e, {% for item in items %} ..action.. {% endfor %}
-- This function requires an opening and closing tag.
-- This is used to loop over every item in a list of items.

**-- u can add a varriable  but u  can add a default


4.If, elif  and else 
This evaluates a varriable or condition, if the condition is satisified,
Or the varriable is true,then the block of code is displayed.
-- The if tag can be used  in conjunction with is_aunthenticated()method
to control what the user sees before and after logging in(authentication)


 *-Filters.
    Filters are used to modify  varriables for display.
    They are written with curly blaces of the varriables and the pipe eg, {demi | Upper}

    examples of Filters

    -lower   -small letters
    eg, {{ name|lower }}
    -Upper   -capital letters
    eg {{ name|upper }}
    -default - if the varriable is  false the default value is used
    eg {{ student|default:'demi'}}
    -Capfirst
    eg {{ city|Capfirst }}
    -length - It is used to return the length of the varriable , and it works on  the lists and strings
    eg {{authour|length }}
    -Filesizeformat - only capitalises the first letter  It formats the value of  the varriable filesize into human readable filesize.
    eg {{kampala|filesizeformat }}
    *linebreak -- converts linebreaks into paragraph <p> tags in html
    eg {{city|linebreak }}
    *escape   - escape text contents. it turns linebreak tag into a p tags.
    eg {{kampala|escape }} 
    *truncatewords ; display the first number of  words you said to a particular varriable
    -{{words|truncatewords: put number of words to truncate}}
    *join ; it filters the arguments that contain spaces must be quoted
    *- to join  a list of spaces  you would use the join filters
    eg -{{students|join:,'}}
    -** Filters can be  changed or nested. the output can be passed on to the next eg,
    {{ text|linebreaks|escape|upper|default:'' }}

    *- Comments; 
    -- used to comment  of a lines of code in dtl.
    -- it is used one  curl blaces and a tag,
    eg nested signs, ie (# comment #)
